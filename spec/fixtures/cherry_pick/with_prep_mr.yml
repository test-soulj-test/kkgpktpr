      string: '[{"id":17911191,"iid":22431,"project_id":13083,"title":"WIP: Prepare
        11.4.0-rc8 release","description":"Main release issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/tasks/issues/460\n\n###
        Summary\n\nThis MR prepares `11-4-stable` for %\"11.4\" (`RC8`) by merging
        `11-4-stable-prepare-rc8` into `11-4-stable`.\n\n### Before the 7th\n\nMerge
        master into the preparation branch\n\n### After the 7th\n\n#### MR Filter
        for ~\"Pick into 11.4\" MRs\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/merge_requests?label_name%5B%5D=Pick+into+11.4\u0026scope=all\u0026state=merged\n\n####
        Note to leave in MRs\n\n```\nPicked into https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/merge_requests/MERGE_REQUEST_ID,
        will merge into `11-4-stable` ready for `11.4 RC8`\n\n/unlabel ~\"Pick into
        11.4\"\n```\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Cherry-pick commits into this MR using the
        link for ~\"Pick into 11.4\" above.\n    - This can be done by checking out
        `11-4-stable-prepare-rc8` locally and using `git cherry-pick -m1 MERGE_COMMIT_SHA`\n    -
        *Note: The quickest way to check the `MERGE_COMMIT_SHA` is to go the Discussion
        tab in the Merge Request. The merge commit SHA will be visible right before
        the comment of it being merged. Sometimes the merge commit SHA will not be
        available in the Discussion tab, in those cases you have to look for it in
        the commits tab for `master`*\n1. Push changes every so often and verify that
        the MR has been included\n1. Leave a note in the MR so others can easily see
        that it is on track to be included in a release.\n    - Remove the ~\"Pick
        into 11.4\" label.\n1. If there are any conflicts while picking MRs then attempt
        to resolve them; otherwise, create a new MR against the `11-4-stable-prepare-rc8`
        branch and assign it to the author of the conflicting files.\n\n1. Once this
        MR is green merge it to stable, preferably with a manual fast-forward merge
        to minimize waiting time, as described in [Merging preparation MRs into stable](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/blob/master/general/picking-into-merge-requests.md#merging-preparation-mrs-into-stable)\n\n###
        Checklist\n\n- [ ] Add changes into the preparation branches:\n  - Before
        the 7th: Master has been merged into the preparation branch\n  - After the
        7th: Changes marked ~\"Pick into 11.4\" have been picked\n\n- [ ] Conflicts
        resolved\n- [ ] No new commits have introduced directly to the stable branch
        while this MR was in progress. If there are, ensure these are merged into
        EE and check for a green pipeline after merging this MR.","state":"opened","created_at":"2018-10-17T19:54:06.769Z","updated_at":"2018-10-17T19:54:14.003Z","target_branch":"11-4-stable","source_branch":"11-4-stable-prepare-rc8","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"author":{"id":15139,"name":"Robert
