        First steps\n\nStable branch should be created after the 7th. The 7th is the
        last date to reliably get things in.\n\n- [x] Assign this issue to all the
        [release managers and trainees](https://about.gitlab.com/release-managers/)\n-
        [x] Create a new slack channel `#f_release_11_7`\n- [x] Set the channel topic
        to `RMs: https://about.gitlab.com/release-managers`\n- [x] Invite all current
        release managers\n- [x] Inside the old release slack channel, notify about
        `#f_release_11_7`\n\n     ```\n     Hello :wave:\n     We are starting 11.7
        into #f_release_11_7\n     Please archive this channel and join #f_release_11_7
        if interested\n     ```\n- [x] Create the ~\"Pick into 11.7\" group label
        if it doesn''t exist: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/labels/new\n  -
        Title: `Pick into 11.7`\n  - Description: ``Merge requests to cherry-pick
        into the `11-7-stable` branch.``\n  - Color: `#00c8ca`\n- [x] Make sure the
        latest [CE to EE] on `master` branches is merged (it will reduce conflicts
        in the future). Ask in `#ce-to-ee` when in doubt.\n- [x] Create branch `11-7-stable`
        from CE `master` manually\n- [x] Create branch `11-7-stable-ee` from EE `master`
        manually\n- [x] In Omnibus create both `11-7-stable` and `11-7-stable-ee`
        from `master` manually\n- [x] Merge GitLab CE into EE on stable branches following
        the [Merging a CE stable branch into its EE counterpart] guide\n- [x] [Sync
        stable branches](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/blob/master/general/push-to-multiple-remotes.md)
        for CE, EE, and Omnibus to `dev`\n- [x] Sync master branches to `dev`, as
        the CHANGELOG will be automatically updated on master during tagging\n- [
        ] If needed, sync tags for dependencies (`gitlab-shell`, `gitlab-workhorse`,
        `gitlab-pages`, `gitaly`) to `dev` (when applicable. Builds should fail if
        this is needed.)\n\n[CE to EE]: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests?label_name[]=CE+upstream\u0026scope=all\u0026state=opened\n[Merging

        RC1\n\n- Follow the [Creating RC1] guide:\n  - [x] Create an MR on **CE**
        master updating the \"Installation from Source\" guide, creating the \"Update\"
        guides\n  - [x] Create an MR on **EE** master creating the \"CE to EE\" guides\n  -
        [x] Ensure the above MRs are merged and marked ~\"Pick into 11.7\"\n  - [x]
        Create a task list for RC1:\n\n      ```sh\n      # In Slack:\n      /chatops
        run release_issue 11.7.0-rc1\n      ```\n  - [x] Link the RC1 issue as a related
        issue in this issue\n\n[Creating RC1]: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/blob/master/general/release-candidates.md#creating-rc1\n\n##
        Subsequent RCs\n\n- [ ] Update the blog post `upgrade barometer` section with
        the migration types for this release, including the time they took to complete.\n-
        Create additional release candidates as needed:\n\n    ```sh\n    # In Slack
        (update RC number):\n    /chatops run release_issue 11.7.0-rc2\n    ```\n-
        [x] Link any subsequent RCs issues as a related issue in this issue\n\nKeep
        in mind that:\n\n1. After the feature freeze only regression, security, and
        documentation fixes should be\n   cherry-picked into stable branches.\n2.
        The final RC should point to the same commit as the final release.\n\n## On
        the first working day after the 7th\n- [x] Follow the [Feature freeze RC](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/blob/master/general/release-candidates.md#feature-freeze-rc)

        besides the oncall confirms, `@mention` the oncall so they are aware.\n  -
        [ ] Confirm there are no critical alerts on gitlab.com on the [alerting dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/SOn6MeNmk/alerts)\n  -

        the release post. Mind that you don''t need their approval if you''re on time\n  -
        If anything goes wrong and the release is delayed, ping the\n  [release post
        manager](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/managers/)\n  on
        Slack to make them aware of the issue. Cross-post the slack message to the
