Update Gitaly to the latest green `master`

## What should I do if this pipeline is red?

* Look at the failure. If it looks unrelated to Gitaly, it's likely a ~"master:broken" or ~"failure::flaky-test".
   1. Open the **Pipelines** tab and click **Run Pipeline**.
   1. This will run a pipeline for merge result.
* If it looks related to Gitaly, notify the Gitaly team in `#g_create_gitaly` on Slack.

## What should I do in case of merge conflicts?

If someone updates `GITALY_SERVER_VERSION` with another MR, we may have a merge conflict.

In such unlikely circumstances, the better option will be closing this merge request and deleting [the `release-tools/update-gitaly` branch](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/branches/all?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search=release-tools%2Fupdate-gitaly).

`release-tools` will take care of creating a new merge request in about 1 hour.
