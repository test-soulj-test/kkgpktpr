Release issue: <%= release_issue_url %>

### Summary

This MR prepares `<%= stable_branch %>` for `<%= version %>`.

### Automated cherry-picking

Merge requests labeled <%= PickIntoLabel.reference(version) %> should be
automatically picked into this MR using the following ChatOps command:

```sh
# In Slack
/chatops run release merge <%= version.to_ce %>
```

### Manual intervention

If merge requests cannot be picked automatically they have to be created
manually targeting `<%= branch_name %>`.
